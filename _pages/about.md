I am currently a PhD student in statistics. I am intereted in developing new methods and theory in machine learning. I enjoy using mathematics to uncover deeper insights into complex problems.

I graduated from Rice University in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and statistics. My statistics senior thesis was advised by [Meng Li](https://meng.rice.edu) and focused on a closed form estimator for the logistic regression problem.

Please check out my blog posts to see the type of things I enjoy learning about (more to come).
