I will be starting my Statistics PhD at UC Berkeley in Fall 2025.

I graduated from Rice University in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and statistics. My statistics senior thesis was advised by [Meng Li](https://meng.rice.edu).

Please check out my blog posts to see the type of things I enjoy learning about.
